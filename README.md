# RoadKill
A  gory little game I'm not sure I'm proud of; I was a teenage boy. Another dude in the computer class did the art.

Interestingly window drawing Java code is easy to convert to JavaScript canvas drawing. Many of the same functions are called on 'graphics' and 'canvas' and the differences are easy to fix.

## Todo
  ### Java
     * bring back standalone application if easy
     * maybe delete whole applet thingy, not supported since 2015
  ### JavaScript
     * Dog poop animation isn't running.
