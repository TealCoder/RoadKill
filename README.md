A  gory little game I'm not sure I'm proud of; I was a teenage boy. Another dude in the computer class did the art.

 * See if apps in the browser is still a good way to run these things.  
   * If so; great
   * if not, swap it back to a native app.
   * either way, if the game code could be de-coupled from the display, that'd be great.
 * Preload images
 * This was a re-skin of an airplane shooter game I coded, but lost the code for. I wonder if I can unskin it again for a less-gory, show-and-tell piece or app.
